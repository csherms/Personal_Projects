This is a simple HTML and CSS website I found on youtube to demonstrate the use of
Jquery for responsive design and mobile first development

// How to use random images from unsplash:
"https://source.unsplash.com/random/?nature,sky"  
All you need is the "/random" part to generate random images
but it is very helpful to set something like "/?nature,water" after the random part to get something specific.
- Also you can size the image like this: "https://source.unsplash.com/random/900Ã—700/?fruit"
- You can use a specific image from unsplash and insert into a <div></div> by it's Id. 
you want to use https://source.unsplash.com/imagesource  to do this
you get "imagesource" by selecting the image on unsplash and copying the last part of the URL

You don't want to grab the slim version because it doesn't include the animate function. 
So grab minified instead. Jquery 3 or higher
